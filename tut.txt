to stage -> git add . (all files in that directory)
             or
            git add fileName 

to commit -> git commit -m "message" ;

restore back to staged -> git restore --staged fileName ;

to see history of changes -> git log ;

these commits are stacked upon each other i.e. u cannot remove a commit from midlle 

to reset a commit to a known commit event -> git reset commit

when u want to draft a commit u can put it to stash after staging it -> git stash
u can get a clean env to work then
